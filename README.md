Google Code-in students: When doing beginner tasks you will be asked to send your submissions to GitHub. This is the right repository for "learning tasks", which are those tasks whose main goal is for you to learn how to do something (such as contribute to an open source project hosted in GitHub, make pull requests and so on).
